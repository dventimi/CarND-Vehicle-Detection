* Introduction
  
  The goals / steps of this project are the following:

  - Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction
    on a labeled training set of images and train a Linear SVM
    classifier
  - Normalize features and randomize a selection for training and
    testing.
  - Implement a sliding-window technique and use trained classifier to
    search for vehicles in images.
  - Run pipeline on a video stream and create a heat map of recurring
    detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected
    vehicles.
  - Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.

* Setup

  The initial setup includes creating the [[https://www.python.org/][Python]] environment with the
  packages that the project needs and uses.

  *NOTE I*: The code for this project can be found in the repository's
  [[file:detect.py][detect.py]] file.  /However/, all of the code in that file was
  generated directly from the code blocks that appear in this file and
  as such, contain no new information.  Reviewers can consult either
  that Python file or this document.

  *NOTE II*: This document is presented in a variety of formats.
  There is this Emacs Org-Mode [[file:writeup.org][file]], a [[file:writeup.pdf][PDF]] generated using /LaTeX/, an
  [[file:writeup.html][HTML]] file, and a [[file:writeup.md][Markdown]] file.  The Markdown file will be rendered
  directly by GitHub when viewed on the web.  The HTML version can be
  rendered either by cloning the repository to your own computer and
  opening the file in a browser locally.  Or, you can view the same
  file in GitHub Pages at [[https://dventimi.github.io/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/writeup.html][this link]].  It looks quite a bit better than
  the GitHub-rendered Markdown version.

  - [[http://matplotlib.org/][matplotlib]] :: plotting and image processing tools
  - [[http://www.numpy.org/][NumPy]] :: foundational scientific computing library
  - [[http://zulko.github.io/moviepy/][MoviePy]] :: video processing tools
  - [[http://opencv.org/][OpenCV]] :: computer vision library

  The [[https://github.com/][GitHub]] [[https://github.com/dventimi/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines][repository]] for this project contains an [[file:environment.yml][environment.yml]]
  file that can be used to create and activate a [[https://conda.io/docs/][Conda]] environment
  with these commands.

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output :tangle no :exports code
  conda create --name CarND-Vehicle-Detection --clone CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines
  source activate CarND-Vehicle-Detection
  conda env export > environment.yml
  #+END_SRC

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output :tangle no :exports code
  conda env create --file environment.yml --name CarND-Vehicle-Detection
  source activate CarND-Vehicle-Detection
  #+END_SRC

  Once activated this environment is used to launch Python in whatever
  way one likes, such as a [[https://www.python.org/shell/][Python shell]], a [[https://ipython.org/][IPython shell]], or a [[http://jupyter.org/][jupyter
  notebook]].  Having done that, the usual first step is to import the
  packages that are used.

* Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

  The first step in this project was to create a vehicle classifier
  that was capable of identifying vehicles in an image, since we can
  treat the frames of the video we are processing as individual
  images.  Broadly, there are two main approaches for this task.  

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision][Computer Vision]]
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network][Neural Networks]]

  Because the emphasis of this module in the Udacity course seemed to
  focus on the computer vision approach, and because we already used
  neural networks for two previous projects, I chose to explore the
  first of these.

  Though the two are similar (and have the same objective:
  classification), one of the hallmarks of the computer vision
  approach seems to be manual [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_extraction][feature extraction]]: relying on human
  experience to select useful features for a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning][machine learning]] problem.
  In the class, we explored several.

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space][color space]] selection
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_binning][binning]] of spatial features
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_histogram][color histograms]]
  - [[http://www.learnopencv.com/histogram-of-oriented-gradients/][histogram of oriented gradients (HOG)]]
  - hybrid approaches

  I experimented with each of these approaches, and with various
  combinations of them, and finally selected a simple combination:
  color space transformation and HOG-features.  Specifically, after
  trying several different color spaces, I settled on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV][HSV]] color
  space and then performed HOG feature extraction on just the /V/
  ("value") channel.  Such a simple feature extractor may seem overly
  simple---and perhaps it is---but the "proof is in the pudding," as
  they say.  It performed well, with decent accuracy on a test sample
  (~98%) and on the project video.  Moreover, it has the virtue of
  requiring relatively few computational resources.  Anything that
  increases performance is a big win, since it promotes rapid,
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development][iterative]] experimentation.  

  Moreover, for the HOG parameters (orientations, pixels_per_cell,
  cells_per_block), I started with the values that we used in the
  quizzes in the lectures, and then manually tuned toward better
  values by simple trial-and-error.  Because the classifier seemed to
  do well on the test set, not much tuning was necessary.

  Let's dive into some code to see how that went.

  To set the stage, we were provided with two data archive files,
  [[file:vehicles.zip][vehicles.zip]] and [[file:non-vehicles.zip][non-vehicles.zip]], which as the names suggest
  contained images of vehicles and things that are not vehicles.

  Here is an example of a vehicle image.

  [[file:vehicles/GTI_MiddleClose/image0000.png]]

  And, here is an example of a non-vehicle image.

  [[file:non-vehicles/GTI/image1.png]]

  The size of each image is 64 x 64 pixels, and the vehicle and
  non-vehicle images are contained (after unpacking the archive files)
  in directories ~vehicle~ and ~non-vehicle~, respectively.  Now,
  whatever classifier we use, we have to start by reading in these
  images one way or another.  Confronted with tasks like this, I like
  to compose small functions based on Python [[http://davidaventimiglia.com/python_generators.html][generators]], so first I
  define a handful of useful utility functions.  

  - feed :: generator function over a [[https://docs.python.org/2/library/glob.html][glob]], which maps a value ~y~ to
	    each filename that matches ~pattern~, yielding [[https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences][tuples]]
  - shuffle :: list-builder function over a sequence of tuples, which
	       [[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reify][reifies]] it into a randomized list
  - scale :: non-generator function, which scales the values in an
	     array, either by the maximum value in the array or by a
	     supplied parameter ~maxval~
  - load :: generator function over a sequence of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair][ordered pairs]] in
	    which the first element is an image filename and the
	    second is any value (perhaps provided by the ~feed~
	    function above), which loads the image files into NumPy
	    arrays
  - flip :: generator function over a sequence of ordered pairs in
	    which the first element is a NumPy array and the second is
	    any value, which "flips" the array horizontally (i.e.,
	    across a vertical axis) and producing a mirror image
  - mirror :: generator function over a sequence of ordered pairs as
	      in ~flip~, but which yields first the entire sequence
	      unchanged and then the entire sequence again but with the
	      images flipped

  #+BEGIN_SRC python -r :results output :session :tangle detect_vehicles.py :comments org :exports code
  feed = lambda pattern, y: ((f, y) for f in glob(pattern))
  shuffle = lambda l: sample(l, len(l))
  scale = lambda img,maxval=None: (img/np.max(img)*255).astype(np.uint8) if maxval==None else (img/maxval*255).astype(np.uint8)
  load = lambda g: ((mpimg.imread(x[0]),x[1]) for x in g)
  flip = lambda g: ((x[0][:,::-1,:],x[1]) for x in g)
  mirror = lambda g: chain(g, flip(g))
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:

  When composed together, these functions provide a generator that
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_loading][lazily loads]] training images in random order, twice: first
  unflipped, and second flipped.  This serves several related
  purposes.  First, randomizing data for training purposes is a
  best-practice in Machine Learning.  Second, it effectively doubles
  the size of our training set.  Third, we anticipate encountering
  vehicles on the road from any angle, where the vehicles themselves
  are inherently symmetric across a vertical plane running
  longitudinally down the length of the car.

  Before we can use this generator, however, we need something to use
  it on.  Let's define our functions for extracting features and for
  creating our classifiers.

  First, the ~extract_features~ function transforms a given image to a
  target color space, performs HOG feature extraction on a target
  color channel, then [[http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#scaling-features-to-a-range][scales]] the features.

  #+BEGIN_SRC python -r :results output :session :tangle detect_vehicles.py :comments org :exports code
  def extract_features(img,
		       colorspace=cv2.COLOR_RGB2HSV,
		       channel=2,
		       orient=9,
		       pix_per_cell=8,
		       cell_per_block=4,
		       transform_sqrt=False,
		       feature_vec=True):
      img = scale(img)
      X = np.array([])
      X = np.append(X,
		    hog(cv2.cvtColor(img, colorspace)[:,:,channel],
			orient,
			(pix_per_cell,pix_per_cell),
			(cell_per_block,cell_per_block),
			transform_sqrt = transform_sqrt,
			feature_vector = feature_vec))
      s = StandardScaler().fit(X)
      return s.transform(X)
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:

  Note that many of the parameters are supplied with default values.
  That is no accident.  The values given above, and repeated here, are
  the ones used throughout this project, and were obtained through
  experimentation by trial-and-error.

  |------------------+-----------------+-----------------------------|
  | Parameter        | Value           | Description                 |
  |------------------+-----------------+-----------------------------|
  | =colorspace=     | =COLOR_RGB2HSV= | target color space          |
  | =channel=        | =2=             | target color channel        |

  | =cell_per_block= | =4=             | cells per HOG block         |
  | =transform_sqrt= | =False=         | scale values by =math.sqrt= |
  | =feature_vec=    | =True=          | return feature vector       |
  |------------------+-----------------+-----------------------------|

  Next, the ~get_classifier~ function returns a function which is
  itself a trained classifier.  Parameters control whether or not to
  train the classifier anew or to load a pre-trained classifier from a
  file, and what the training/test set split should be when training a
  new one.

  #+BEGIN_SRC python -r :results output :session :tangle detect_vehicles.py :comments org :exports code
  def get_classifier(reload=False,test_size=0.2):
      if reload:
	  samples = list(chain(feed("vehicles/**/*.png",1),feed("non-vehicles/**/*.png",0)))
	  data = cycle(mirror(load(shuffle(samples))))
	  X_train,X_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(*zip(*((extract_features(s[0]), s[1]) for s in islice(data, len(samples)))), test_size=test_size, random_state=np.random.randint(0, 100))
	  svc = LinearSVC()
	  svc.fit(X_train, y_train)
	  pickle.dump(svc, open("save.p","wb"))
	  print('Test Accuracy of SVC = ', round(classifier.score(X_test, y_test), 4))
      else:
	  svc = pickle.load(open("save.p", "rb"))
      return svc
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:

  Note the use of our composable utility functions to load the data
  [[(compose1)][here]] and [[(compose2)][here]].  Note also that there are a variety of classifiers we
  could use.

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine][Support Vector Machine (SVM)]]
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest][Random Forest]]
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier][Naive Bayes]]

  I was prepared to experiment with each of these, and perhaps with
  their combinations.  I started with an SVG, however, and found that
  it performed well all on its own.

  Training a classifier now is as simple as

  #+BEGIN_SRC python -r :results output :session :tangle detect_vehicles.py :comments org :exports both
  # classifier = get_classifier(True)
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:
  : Test Accuracy of SVC =  0.9938

  while loading a saved classifier is even simpler

  #+BEGIN_SRC python -r :results output :session :tangle detect_vehicles.py :comments org :exports code
  classifier = get_classifier()
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:

  Saving and re-loading classifiers like in this second command was
  very helpful in this project for promoting rapid iteration, because
  once I had a classifier I was happy with, I could move onto
  subsequent stages in the project without needing to retrain the
  classifier every time. 

* Sliding Window Search I

  I performed the most experimentation on various sliding window
  schemes.  Initially, I expended effort on behalf of a single idea:
  /Can I model vehicle position not in screen coordinates, measured in
  pixels, but rather in real-world coordinates, measured in meters?/
  My strategy was to generate sliding windows on a three-dimensional
  (3D) grid whose origin is where the camera is placed and whose units
  are meters, and then use geometry to project those windows onto the
  screen in pixel coordinates.  This model has these assumptions.

  - The image plane roughly corresponds to the vehicle's windshield.
  - The windshield is approximately 2 meters wide, 1 meter tall, and 2
    meters above the road.
  - The camera is placed approximately 1 meter behind the windshield's
    center, with a line-of-sight (LOS) perpendicular to it.
  - The grid coordinates $\left( x, y, z \right)_{grid}$ correspond to
    the horizontal position across the road, the vertical position
    above the road, and the longitudinal position down the road.
  - Positive $x$ values are to the right, negative $x$ values are to
    the left, and $x_{grid} \in \left[ -15, 15 \right]$.
  - Negative $y$ values are below the camera, and $y_{grid} \in \left[
    -2, 0 \right]$.
  - $z \lt 1$ values are inside the car, and $z_{grid} \in \left[ 10,
    100 \right]$.

  These assumptions determine the geometry of the problem and set its
  physical scale, with a field-of-view (FOV) of 90°, and allow us to
  create sliding windows as described above.  In principle, vehicle
  detections on image patches can then be assigned real-world
  coordinates $(x, y, z)$, or at least road coordinates $(x,
  z)_{y=0}$, a real-world "heat map" can be built up, and then
  individual vehicles can be identified either with conventional
  thresholds + [[http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/segmentation/plot_label.html][labeling]], with a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blob_detection][Laplace-of-Gaussian]] technique, or
  with [[https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.18.1/reference/cluster.vq.html][/k/-means clustering]].

  The following coordinate conversion functions support the geometrical model outlined
  above.

  - crt2cyl :: Cartesian-to-cylindrical
  - cyl2crt :: cylindrical-to-Cartesian
  - cyl2sph :: cylindrical-to-spherical
  - sph2cyl :: spherical-to-cylindrical
  - crt2sph :: Cartesian-to-spherical
  - sph2crt :: spherical-to-Cartesian

  #+BEGIN_SRC python -r :results output :session :tangle detect_vehicles.py :comments org :exports code
  crt2cyl = lambda x,y,z: (math.sqrt(x**2+y**2), math.atan2(y,x), z)
  cyl2crt = lambda rho,phi,z: (rho*math.cos(phi), rho*math.sin(phi), z)
  cyl2sph = lambda rho,phi,z: (math.sqrt(rho**2+z**2), math.atan2(rho, z), phi)
  sph2cyl = lambda r,theta,phi: (r*math.sin(theta), phi, r*math.cos(theta))
  crt2sph = lambda x,y,z: (math.sqrt(x**2+y**2+z**2), math.acos(z/math.sqrt(x**2+y**2+z**2)), math.atan2(y,x))
  sph2crt = lambda r,theta,phi: (r*math.sin(theta)*math.cos(phi), r*math.sin(theta)*math.sin(phi), r*math.cos(theta))
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:

  The ~get_window~ function computes from $(x,y,z)$ a "window", which
  is a list of tuples wherein the first two provide the corners of its
  "bounding box" and the last provides the coordinates of its center.
  Note that it also takes ~height~ and ~width~ parameters for the
  physical size (in meters) of the window, as well as a ~horizon~
  parameter, which is the fraction of the image plane (from below) at
  which the horizon appears.  The default value of ~0.5~ corresponds
  to the middle.  Finally, like many of my functions it takes a NumPy
  image array parameter, ~img~, which is mainly for extracting the
  size and shape of the image.

  #+BEGIN_SRC python -r :results output :session :tangle detect_vehicles.py :comments org :exports code
  def get_window(img, x, y, z, horizon=0.5, width=2, height=2):
      d = 1
      r,theta,phi = crt2sph(x,y,z)
      rho2 = d*math.tan(theta)
      x2,y2 = (rho2*math.cos(phi),rho2*math.sin(phi))
      center = (int(img.shape[1]*0.5+x2*img.shape[1]//2),
                int(img.shape[0]*(1-horizon)-y2*img.shape[1]//2))
      scale = img.shape[1]//2
      dx = int(width/2*scale/z)
      dy = int(height/2*scale/z)
      window = [(center[0]-dx,center[1]-dy), (center[0]+dx,center[1]+dy)] + [(x,y,z)]
      return window
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:

  Next, the ~draw_window~ function annotates an image ~img~ with the
  window ~bbox~.  This does not factor into the actual vehicle
  detection, of course, but the visualization is valuable for
  understanding how the video processing pipeline ultimately is
  working.

      cv2.rectangle(img, bbox[0], bbox[1], color, thick)
      return img
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:

  For example, first we draw a window box that roughly corresponds to
  the windshield itself, using a test image from the lecture notes.
  The windshield's center is at real-world coordinates
  $(x,y,z)_{windshield} = (0,0,1)$.

  Next, we draw window boxes around a few of the cars in the image.
  Note that here we are eschewing the default value of ~horizon~ in
  favor of ~0.28~, given the peculiar tilt the camera seems to have in
  this image.  That value, like the real-world vehicle coordinates
  $(x,y,z)_i$, were obtained by hand through trial-and-error.

  This is just for visualization.  For vehicle detection, a denser
  grid should be used, and we raster the windows horizontally as they
  ratchet down-range.  We also confine the windows to a horizontal
  plane, at $z = -1$.  But, because this sliding window and other ones
  like it actually will be used in the vehicle-detection
  video-processing pipeline, it is worthwhile to remove windows that
  exceed the image boundary.  That is the purpose of the ~clip_window~
  function.

  #+BEGIN_SRC python -r :results output :session :tangle detect_vehicles.py :comments org :exports code
  def clip_window(x, box):
      return sum([box[0]<=x[0][0]<=box[1],

                  box[2]<=x[0][1]<=box[3],
                  box[2]<=x[1][1]<=box[3]])==4
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:

  
  Since our strategy will be to write functions to produce "grids"
  that can be used both for visualization and for vehicle-detection,
  we refactor much of the animated visualization into a new function,
  ~get_frame_maker~.

  #+BEGIN_SRC python -r :results value :session :tangle detect_vehicles.py :comments org :exports code

          return frame
      return make_frame

  With these tools, first we define a "sparse grid"

  We can also define a "dense grid" with more windows, scanning the
  roadway with finer resolution in the $x$ and $z$ directions.  We
  skip the animation this time, as it is rather boring.

  The sparse scan above probably is too sparse, but one way we can

  Sadly, this barely makes a dent in reducing the number of windows.

  In order to make headway, a simple choice is just to stick with the
  dense grid, perform vehicle detections with it against a test image,
  and gauge its performance.

  To do that, we need a function ~get_patches~, that takes a /window/,
  which again is mainly a bounding-box (with pixel dimensions) into a
  /patch/, which is a NumPy image sub-array taken from a larger image.

  #+BEGIN_SRC python -r :results output :session :tangle detect_vehicles.py :comments org :exports code
  def get_patches(img, grid, size=(64,64)):
      return ((cv2.resize(img[window[0][1]:window[1][1],
                              window[0][0]:window[1][0]],size),window) for window in grid)
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:

  Armed with that function, next we just map our classifier over all
  of the window patches on an image.

  #+BEGIN_SRC python -r :results output :session :tangle detect_vehicles.py :comments org :exports code
  def process(x):
      return (classifier.predict(extract_features(x[0]))[0],x[1])
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:

  #+BEGIN_SRC python -r :results output :session :tangle detect_vehicles.py :comments org :exports both
  results = list(map(process, get_patches(image, dense_scan(image))))
  print(len(results))
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:
  : 
  : 2653

  To visualize where vehicle detections have occurred on our dense grid
  over the road, we filter the processed results that have a value
  greater than 1 (i.e., a detection has occurred for that window patch)

  #+BEGIN_SRC python -r :results output :session :tangle detect_vehicles.py :comments org :exports both
  _,r = zip(*filter(lambda x: x[0]>0, results))
  _,_,cen,_ = zip(*r)
  x,y,z = zip(*cen)
  plt.scatter(x,z,s=50,c=y)

  These results are interesting and suggestive.  The contiguous
  regions of detections presumably correspond to vehicles, with their
  2D location associated with the "center" of each island.  However,
  projection effects seem to elongate the detected regions with a
  strong, pronounced radial pattern, which could be problematic.
  Perhaps with suitable thresholding, a technique as simple as the
  ~label~ function would be sufficient for picking out the cars.  On
  the other hand, we might need more sophisticated techniques, such as
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blob_detection][Laplace-of-Gaussian]] or with [[https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.18.1/reference/cluster.vq.html][/k/-means clustering]].  This is an
  intriguing direction of inquiry to pursue in further studies,
  however in this one I found that I was running out of time.  
  
  So, I switched gears to a more traditional sliding windows approach.

* Sliding Window Search II

  To refresh the reader, a more traditional sliding windows approach
  models a grid of windows and their image patches not in real-world
  3D physical space, but in 2D image space.  This involves trade-offs.
  On the one hand, we give up a straightforward 3D interpretation of a
  vehicle detection event.  In principle, we could still recover
  distance information by deprojecting the window (the reverse of our
  operation above), but at the expense of greater complication.  On
  the other hand, we gain with this trade-off a simpler implementation
  that already has a proven track-record.

  We can reuse much of our other code, though, since we just need to
  define functions to produce grids that obey whatever selection
  functions we desire.

  First up is a simple "image-plane scan", which carpets the image
  plane in a uniform grid of windows at various fixed scales.

  #+BEGIN_SRC python -r :results output :session :tangle detect_vehicles.py :comments org :exports code
  def image_plane_scan(img,ny,overlap,scale):
      size = int(img.shape[0]//ny)//scale
      delta = int(size*(1-overlap))
      box1 = (0,
              img.shape[1],
              (img.shape[0]-img.shape[0]//scale)//2,
              img.shape[0] - (img.shape[0]-img.shape[0]//scale)//2)
      box2 = (0,
              img.shape[1],
              (img.shape[0]//2),
              img.shape[0])
      grid = np.mgrid[0:img.shape[1]:delta,
                      img.shape[0]:-delta:-delta].T.reshape(-1,2)
      grid = ([(c[0],c[1]), (c[0]+size,c[1]+size)] for c in grid)
      grid = filter(lambda x: clip_window(x, box1), grid)

  This produces 1400+ images, which highlights a persistent problem I
  grappled with.  There is an inherent trade-off between the accuracy
  of a dense window sample, and the performance of a sparse window sample.

  A conjecture I had to help ease the tension between these two poles
  was to relax the constraint of a regular grid of windows in favor of
  a random scattering of windows.  One of the reasons the window count
  soared with a regular grid was the overlap; a high degree of overlap
  (>50%) was needed for higher spatial resolution of detected vehicle
  locations, but the number of windows is essentially quadratic in the
  degree of overlap.  However, the stochastic behavior of an irregular
  random sampling of windows means that a higher spatial resolution
  can be achieved in an economy of window patches.  

  The trade-offs here, however, are two-fold.  First, we no longer can
  pre-compute the grid, but instead must compute a new random ensemble
  of windows for each video frame.  In the testing that I did, this
  proved to be of little concern; the Python profiler, and experience
  as well, showed that the grid computation time was relatively
  trivial.  The bulk of the time was spent on feature extraction and
  classification for each window patch, a task that obviously cannot
  be precomputed irrespective of the grid strategy.

  Second, since any one /particular/ frame is treated with a
  relatively sparse (but now random) irregular grid of windows, this
  intensifies the need for integrating the signal over multiple frames
  (a task we anticipated in any case).  Consequently, we lose
  resolution in the time domain.  While that could be a problem for
  fast-moving vehicles, it was not for the relatively slow relative
  velocity of the vehicles in our project video.

  My first version of a random scan uses a region-of-interest mask
  that selects out a trapezoidal region covering just the border of
  the road.

  #+BEGIN_SRC python -r :results output :session :tangle detect_vehicles.py :comments org :exports code
  def region_of_interest(img, vertices):
      mask = np.zeros_like(img)   
      if len(img.shape) > 2:
          channel_count = img.shape[2]
          ignore_mask_color = (255,) * channel_count
      else:
          ignore_mask_color = 255
      cv2.fillPoly(mask, vertices, ignore_mask_color)
      masked_image = cv2.bitwise_and(img, mask)
      return masked_image
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:

  The actual function ~random_scan~ takes an image ~img~ (again, just
  for the size information), and a window size.  Since these we are
  now operating in the pixel coordinates of the image plane rather
  than in the physical coordinates of the real world, the window size
  is taken just in pixels.  This function works by thresholding a
  random array.  It is a somewhat elegant technique, but is
  inefficient and /slowww/.

  This produces an interesting pattern, but I was not comfortable
  peculiar way the windows are scaled to different sizes, so I wrote
  yet another grid window function ~random_scan4~, which is a bit of a
  hybrid.  It actually re-uses the 3D model described above in
  *Sliding Window Search I*.  Windows are defined in a 3D volume which
  covers the road from left to right, from the car to the horizon, and
  from the camera level down to the road.  I.e., it is like a long,
  thick "ribbon", within which windows are randomly sampled.  As
  above, we are back in physical space for window sizes, rather than
  in pixel space.  Finally, the physical space windows are projected
  back onto the image plane to give us a grid window in pixel-space.
  In fact, this is almost exactly as we did in the earlier section.
  The main differences are:

  1. We discard the 3D window location information after projecting it
     to a grid window on the image plane.
  2. Window locations are randomly drawn from the 3D volume described
     above, rather than laid out in a regular array.

  Note that the above function takes parameters =width= and =left=
  which set the width of the "ribbon" volume, and its left edge (in
  meters).  We can easily combine a couple calls to this grid
  generating function with judicious parameter choices in order to
  archive interesting search patterns.  For instance, in
  ~random_scan5~, we superimpose two ribbons, one on the left, and one
  on the right, in order just to search the road borders.

  While we may not want to search in this way in general, since the
  void in the middle is a giant "blind spot", as a visualization this
  has the nice property of removing foreground windows so that the way
  they naturally scale with distance is revealed.  

* Video Implementation

  With a variety of strategies for searching a video frame for vehicle
  detection events, the next major step is to adapt those strategies
  into an implementation of a video-processing pipeline.  The
  processing pipeline has these major steps.

  1. Get a frame of video.
  2. Generate a grid of windows using one of the schemes developed
     above.
  3. Using the frame image and the grid of windows, generate a
     sequence of patches, which are small (64 x 64 pixel) sub-arrays,
     compatible with our classifier.
  4. Apply the classifier as a stencil over the sequence of patches to
     generate a sequence of detection/non-detection events.
  5. Assign a positive value (1) to the bounding box associated with
     each window/patch, and superimpose these detection patches to
     create a 2D histogram, which we'll call a "heat map."
  6. Apply a threshold to the heat map for each frame, by selecting
     only those array values that exceed the threshold.
  7. Use the [[http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.measure.html#skimage.measure.label][=label=]] function to identify connected regions in the
     thresholded heat map, and associate these with "vehicles."
  8. Annotate the original frame image with a bounding box for each
     vehicle.

  The previous sections were largely the province of Steps 2, 3, and 4
  above.  Picking up from there with step 5, we need to build up a
  heat map.  The ~add_heat~ function does just that.  It takes
  single-channel image array ~heatmap~ (typically, all zeros) and a
  list of window/patches in ~bbox_list~, and builds up the
  histogram/heat map.

      return heatmap
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:

  For step 6, we add the function ~apply_threshold~, which selects out
  of a heatmap image array ~heat~ only those array elements that
  exceed ~threshold~.

  boxes for detected vehicles, and annotates the frame image with a
  box.

  Satisfied that we are acquiring the pieces we need, we are almost
  ready to create our actual video-processing pipeline.  Before doing
  that, however, we must address the related topics of
  false-positives, buffering, smoothing, moving averages, and
  time-space resolution.

  In the video-processing pipeline, the raw signal will be coming at
  us at a full 25 frames per second, with a lot of noise associated
  with highly-transient "false-positive" detection events at locations
  where there is no vehicle.  A tried-and-true way of coping with this
  is to buffer the signal over some time interval (which corresponds
  to some number of frames), integrate the signal over that buffer,
  and substitute a (possibly weighted) moving average over the buffer
  for the raw signal.  This smooths and conditions the signal,
  largely eliminating false-positive detections and "jitter", though
  it comes at a small price.  Our time-domain resolution dilates from
  the raw frame-rate to the time interval associated with our
  smoothing buffer.  Consequently, we should take care to make our
  buffer "long enough, and no longer"; it should remove most false
  positives, but still distinguish different cars, for instance.  

  One way to implement smoothing is to introduce a bona-fide
  frame-buffer, such as with a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer][ring buffer]] like Python's [[https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.deque][~deque~]]
  data-structure.  

  However, it turns out that is not at all necessary.

  Instead, we can embellish the analogy we have adopted of a "heat
  map" with the idea of "cooling."  First, we move the heat map data
  structure (typically, a 1-channel 2-D image array of the same size
  as a video frame) /outside/ of the main processing loop.  A global
  variable, a local variable in a [[https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/closure][closure]], or a class object's member
  variable all are good candidates here.  Then, in our main processing
  loop, for each video frame we deliver a "heat pulse" into the heat
  map, through the ~add_heat~ map function above, for instance.  By
  itself, that would integrate the signal over the whole video.  To
  recover the notions of a short-interval buffer, a moving average,
  and a smoothing kernel, we just insert a "cooling" step before the
  heat pulse.  I.e., we "cool" the heat map by dis-integrating some of
  its accumulated signal.  A simple way to do that is just to
  down-scale it by a small /cooling factor/---say 1%---by multiplying
  it by a fraction.

  In fact, doing this imitates none other than one of the simplest and
  oldest-known cooling laws in Nature, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_law_of_cooling][Newton's Law of Cooling]].  This
  is the cooling law for conductive media, and corresponds precisely
  to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing][exponential smoothing]]

  \[ \Delta T (t) = \Delta T (0) e^{-t/t_0} \]

  where $t_0$ is the cooling time-scale and relates to the cooling
  factor.  Just as a guide, the following table lists the approximate
  time for the heat map to cool by one-half, at the video's 25 frames
  per second, for a handful of cooling factors.

  |----------------+--------------------|
  | Cooling Factor | Cooling Time-Scale |
  |----------------+--------------------|
  |           0.99 | 3 seconds          |
  |           0.98 | 1.5 seconds        |
  |           0.97 | 1 second           |
  |           0.95 | 0.5 second         |
  |           0.90 | 10 milliseconds    | 

  This is the buffering strategy we use here, and it works quite
  well.  I decide to go for an object-oriented approach, so I made the
  heat map into an object member variable.

  The ~Component~ class defines that object, along with a host of
  other attributes and methods for performing the video processing.
  Hyper-parameters that govern the operation of the pipeline are
  injected via the object constructor, and that includes the
  ~cooling_factor~ described above.  Its default value is 0.98, for a
  cooling time of between 1 and 2 seconds.  Note that most of the
  class functions really are just thin wrappers over the functions we
  developed above.  The main exception to that is the ~get_out_img~
  function, which composes the "scene" for the video frame.  It
  supports an "extended" branch of operation wherein the main video
  window is supplemented with smaller windows animating the grid
  windows, and the evolving heat map.  In its layout, I made room for
  5 such smaller windows, though in the end I only needed 2 of them.

  The test video is very short, so there barely is enough time for
  "heat to build up" to the point that one car is detected, let alone
  two.

  As this video is in "extended mode", you can see both the animated
  grid windows, and the evolving heat map.  Note that here, we
  actually have moved away from ~image_plane_scan~ for generating the
  grid windows, and in fact are using ~random_scan4~ which, the reader
  will recall, lays out grids randomly in "physical space" in a volume
  that corresponds to a long, thick "ribbon".  Here, the ribbon
  extends across the road and from the road up to camera height.  The
  randomness of the windows should be self-evident from the video.

  There still are a few transient false-positives at a few places,
  unfortunately.  More tuning of the cooling, thresholding, and other
  parameters might banish them.

  Finally, we repeat processing for the main project video, but not in
  extended mode.  This mainly was so that I could get a sense of the
  difference in processing times.  In fact, it cuts the processing
  time by about a half, indicating that generating, resizing, and
  composing together all the windows introduces considerable
  overhead.  

  #+BEGIN_SRC python -r :results value :session :tangle detect_vehicles.py :comments org :exports code
  in_clip = VideoFileClip("project_video.mp4")
  scene = Component(scale(mpimg.imread("test_images/test1.jpg")),threshold=40,cooling_factor=0.99,extended=False)
  out_clip = in_clip.fl_image(scene.process_image)
  out_clip.write_videofile("output_images/project_output.mp4", audio=False)
  #+END_SRC

  This video is largely the same as the previous one, save for the
  fact that the smaller sub-windows are not present

* Discussion

  I found this to be a very stimulating, but also a very challenging
  project.  I believe it would have been much easier had I used any of
  the code that Udacity provided in the lectures, however I rejected
  that almost completely.  But, that opened up the possibility to try
  other interesting techniques.  

  To recap, some of the alternative techniques I enjoyed adding were
  these.  

  - Use dead-simple feature extraction based on just 1-channel HOG
    extraction.
  - Flip the training images horizontally to essentially double the
    training set size.
  - Tried modeling sliding windows, and estimating vehicle
    detections, in 3-D real-world physical coordinates.  Though I
    never got to the last step, I re-used much of the 3-D
    projection/deprojection code, and it added additional insight.
  - Used random windows rather than strictly overlapping windows laid
    out on a regular array.
  - Re-used the 3-D projection/deprojection code so as to scale the
    window sizes automatically with distance.
  - Borrowed from Nature in order to implement exponential
    moving-average buffering of the heat map, without ever having to
    buffer any actual heat map frames.
  - Adorned the main video output window with animations of the grid
    windows and of the evolving heat map, which aided in parameter
    tuning and added additional insight.

    Of course, I also believe I met the main objectives for the
    project.  

  - Performed a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature
    extraction on a labeled training set of images and trained a
    classifier.

  - Normalized the features and randomized the selection for training
    and testing.

  - Implemented a sliding-window technique and used the trained
    classifier to search for vehicles in images.

  - Ran a pipeline on video streams and created a heat map of
    recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow
    detected vehicles.

  - Estimated a bounding box for detected vehicles.

*** Rubric Points

***** DONE Explain how (and identify where in your code) you extracted HOG features from the training images.

      This is described above in the section *Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)*

***** DONE Explain how you settled on your final choice of HOG parameters.

      This also is described above.  To recap, I started with the HOG
      parameters we used in the quizzes in the lecture, and then
      manually tuned them from there.  Not much tuning was needed.

***** DONE Describe how (and identify where in your code) you trained a classifier using your selected HOG features

      This is described above in the section *Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)*

***** DONE Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search.

      This is described above in the sections *Sliding Window Search I* and *Sliding Window Search II*.

***** DONE How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?

      This is described above in the sliding windows sections.  To
      recap, in the end since I modeled the windows in 3-D real world
      physical coordinates before projecting them onto the image
      plane, the sliding windows automatically scaled with distance. 

***** DONE Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working. 

      Example test images of the heat map and detected vehicles appear
      above in the *Video Implementation*.  Beyond that, insight into
      how the pipeline is working can be gleaned by the animated grid
      windows and evolving heat map sub-windows in the 2 of the 3
      processed videos.  

***** DONE How did you optimize the performance of your classifier?

      I did not spend a great deal of time trying to optimize the
      performance of the classifier.  Largely, my steps toward
      optimization the whole pipeline comprised these things.

      1. Stuck to a ruthlessly simple classifier:  1-channel HOG
         feature extraction only.
      2. Reduced the total number of sliding windows.  Using random
         windows helped with this a great deal.
      3. (Optionally) remove the sub-windows during video processing.

      Even still, the processing does not work in real-time.  In order
      for that to occur, I might have to skip some frames, add in some
      multiprocessing features, or try more advance techniques.

***** DONE Provide a link to your final video output.

      Obviously, this is done above. 

***** DONE Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video

      I have somewhat wobbly and slightly unstable bounding boxes but
      am identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false
      positives.

***** DONE Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of filter for false positives

      This is described above in the *Video Implementation* section.
      To recap, I "cool" the heat map between frames simply by
      multiplying it by a fraction close to 1 (~0.99).  This provides
      a nice, exponential moving average.

***** DONE Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.

      Combining or "overlapping" windows occurs by virtue of two
      factors:  random window placement, and integrating multiple
      frames into a heat map.  Random window placement means that even
      with a small overall number of windows, the likelihood that
      windows will overlap is very high, especially integrating over
      multiple frames, and that's exactly what we do with the heat
      map.  

***** DONE Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project. 

      The main problem I had was that my ambitious goal of identifying
      vehicles in 3D proved too challenging given the time allotted.
      Beyond that, I paid a price in not optimizing the video
      processing performance, in that it made parameter tuning a slow
      and tedious process.

      Another problem I notice is that, despite the good performance
      of the classifier on the test set, in the video it seems it
      succeeds in identifying cars largely based on the tail-lights on
      the back of the cars.  This a problem insofar as when cars enter
      the stage, the classifier is relatively unaware of it until the
      tail of the car enters the stage as well.

***** DONE Where will your pipeline likely fail? 

      The pipeline likely will fail under challenging lighting
      conditions because I did not attempt to make it more robust
      along that dimension.  And, because I did not optimize
      aggressively for performance, it probably would be impractical
      at much higher frame rates.

***** DONE What could you do to make it more robust?

      There are many things I could do to make it more robust.  

      1. Back off from a simple classifier, and add in color
         histograms, spatial binning, etc.
      2. Perhaps switch to a Convolutional Neural Network classifier.
      3. Aggressively optimize performance.  This would make it more
         robust insofar as it would make aggressive hyper-parameter
         optimization more feasible.
      4. The thresholding/labeling approach to identifying vehicles is
         not very robust.  SciKit has a [[http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/features_detection/plot_blob.html][variety]] of "Blob Detection"
         tools, with various performance characteristics.
      5. With better vehicle detection, instead of applying a sliding
         window search agnostically, it could be done just in the
         neighborhood of known cars.  I actually started heading down
         this path, and this is the main reason I adopted an
         object-oriented approach.  Alas, time pressures forced me to
         abandon it.

      As you can see, there is much room for improvement.
      Nevertheless, I am happy with my solution, and pleased that I
      discovered a few new (to me) techniques along the way.
