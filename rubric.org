* TODO Writeup
*** TODO Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one. 
*** TODO Include a statement and supporting figures / images that explain how each rubric item was addressed, and specifically where in the code each step was handled.
*** TODO Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
*** TODO Explain how (and identify where in your code) you extracted HOG features from the training images.
*** TODO Explain how you settled on your final choice of HOG parameters.
*** TODO Include which color space was chosen and why.
*** TODO Include which HOG parameters (orientations, pixels_per_cell, cells_per_block) were chosen and why.
* TODO Sliding Window Search
*** TODO Describe how (and identify where in your code) you trained a classifier using your selected HOG features (and color features if you used them).
*** TODO Features should be scaled to zero mean and unit variance before training the classifier.
*** TODO Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search.
*** TODO How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?
*** TODO Give Some justification for the particular implementation chosen.
*** TODO Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working.
*** TODO How did you optimize the performance of your classifier?
*** TODO Give some discussion around how you improved the reliability of the classifier i.e., fewer false positives and more reliable car detections (this could be things like choice of feature vector, thresholding the decision function, hard negative mining etc.)
* TODO Video Implementation
*** TODO Provide a link to your final video output.
*** TODO Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.)
*** TODO Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of filter for false positives.
*** TODO Describe some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.
* TODO Discussion
*** TODO Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project. Where will your pipeline likely fail? What could you do to make it more robust?
* TODO Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!
*** TODO Create a pipeline that runs in near real time (at least several frames per second on a good laptop) and does a great job of identifying and tracking vehicles in the frame with a minimum of false positives.
*** TODO Combine this vehicle detection pipeline with the lane finding implementation from the last project!
*** TODO Record your own video and run your pipeline on it to detect vehicles under different conditions.
